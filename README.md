## üèóÔ∏è Application Architecture & Core Components

For an in-depth understanding of architectural components, their specific roles, and their interdependencies, please refer to the **"Foundation of the Application"** and **"Communication Architecture"** sections in the accompanying [PDF](./wavelength.pdf).

## üõ†Ô∏è Underlying Technologies

Wavelength is built upon a foundation of best possible technologies, ensuring reliability, exceptional performance, and scalability. My choice of tools reflects our commitment to quality, efficiency, and future-proofing the application:

- **Qt5:** Yeah. I know Qt6 is available, but I've sticked to the 5th version. The powerful cross-platform application development framework serves as the backbone of Wavelength. It provides the necessary tools for creating rich graphical user interfaces, robust application logic, and handles low-level system interactions. Its extensive module ecosystem (Qt Core, Qt GUI, Qt Widgets, Qt Network, Qt Multimedia, Qt OpenGL, etc.) accelerates development and ensures broad platform compatibility across Windows, and Linux (none of the development was tested on macOS, if you are willing to take a shot, contant me :D).
- **OpenGL:** Utilized extensively for rendering high-quality graphics and ensuring a smooth visual experience across various devices. Its direct access to hardware capabilities allows for efficient and performant rendering of all visual elements within the application, contributing to its fluid and responsive interface.
- **FFmpeg:** An indispensable open-source library for handling and decoding diverse multimedia formats. Its robust capabilities for processing audio and video are crucial for Wavelength's seamless multimedia support, enabling efficient encoding, decoding, and streaming of various media types, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of files.
- **Other Essential Libraries and Frameworks:** A variety of other specialized libraries are integrated to handle specific functionalities such as secure network communication protocols (e.g., for data encryption), efficient data serialization (e.g., JSON parsing for configuration or API calls), cryptographic operations for security, and more, all contributing to the application's comprehensive feature set and robust performance.

A detailed overview of the technologies employed, their specific roles, and their application within the Wavelength project can be found in the **"Technologies"** section of the [PDF](./wavelength.pdf).

## üöß Challenges and Solutions

For a more detailed technical dive into the specific challenges faced and the solutions implemented, please refer to the **"Issues and solutions"** section within the accompanying [PDF](./wavelength.pdf).

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements

To ensure optimal performance and a smooth user experience, please ensure your system meets the following minimum requirements. Meeting these specifications will provide the best Wavelength experience.

- **Operating System:** The one that supports GUI.
- **Processor:** The working one.
- **RAM:** 2 GB of RAM or more recommended for comfortable usage. 2 GB should be perfectly fine.
- **Graphics:** A dedicated or integrated graphics card with OpenGL 2.1 support or higher. Modern GPUs with OpenGL 3.3+ (or Vulkan/DirectX equivalents) are highly recommended for the best visual experience and hardware-accelerated rendering. This one is actually pretty neccessary for GPU acceleration through various of animations.
- **Network:** Stable internet connection is required for all real-time communication features (text chat, PTT, multimedia sharing).

The requirements are really low for today standards and that was exactly my goal.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Currently, there is only one way to use Wavelength on your system. It's by builing it from source.

### For Developers: Building Wavelength from Source

If you're a developer, want to contribute, or prefer to host and build the application yourself, follow these steps. This process gives you full control and allows for custom modifications.

#### Prerequisites for Building

Before you begin, ensure you have the following development tools and libraries installed on your system:

1.  **Git:** For cloning the repository.
    - [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2.  **CMake (version 3.16 or higher):** For managing the build process.
    - [Download CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
3.  **Qt5 (version 5.x.x):** The core framework. You will need the development libraries for the following Qt modules: `Qt Core`, `Qt GUI`, `Qt Widgets`, `Qt Network`, and `Qt Multimedia` (including `Q5MultimediaWidgets`).
4.  **FFmpeg Development Libraries:** Essential for multimedia support (audio/video decoding, encoding, streaming). You'll need libraries like `libavcodec-dev`, `libavformat-dev`, `libavutil-dev`, etc.

    - **On Ubuntu/Debian:** `sudo apt update && sudo apt install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev`
    - **On Fedora:** `sudo dnf install ffmpeg-devel`
    - **On Windows:** This is more complex. You'll typically download pre-built FFmpeg development packages (e.g., from [Gyan.dev](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) or [BtbN](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases)), extract them, and then add their `bin` and `lib` directories to your system's PATH or include them directly in your project configuration.
      Using a package manager like MSYS2/vcpkg is often simpler, since my recommendation: **use** `vcpkg`.

5.  **C++ Compiler:** A C++20 compatible compiler toolchain installed for your operating system.
6.  **libpqxx** library - managing PostgreSQL database and connection.

After setting up everything, you should be able to just compile the cloned repo/code on your own machine. By default, Wavelength uses exterrnal server, so for a solitary experience, host your own server, by installing `Node` and neccessary packages from [server directory](./server/) - `npm i`.

Configuration of your own server can be provided via `Wavelength Settings` tab (in application), where you can paste your `server address` and `server port`.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

I've currently found only one issue when using PTT in chat. The issue is only related to `Arch Linux` and `arch` based linuxes family, since they have very minimalistic pre-installed configurations. You need to properly configure **audio pipeline**.

```
sudo pacman -S pipewire-pulse pipewire-alsa pipewire-jack
```

```
systemctl --user restart pipewire pipewire-pulse wireplumber
```

Also, _Arch_ has some problems with audio buffers (again: lack of bunch of mostly default pre-installed audio codecs), so for using Arch (just like me: I use arch, btw.) it is advised to use `archlinux-audio-fix` branch.

Rest of the issues, enhancements and ideas for future or in development can be seen in [Issue](https://github.com/szymonwilczek/wavelength/issues) GitHub tab.
