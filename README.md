## üöÄ Getting Started

Currently, there is only one way to use Wavelength on your system. It's by builing it from source.

### For Developers: Building Wavelength from Source

If you're a developer, want to contribute, or prefer to host and build the application yourself, follow these steps. This process gives you full control and allows for custom modifications.

#### Prerequisites for Building

Before you begin, ensure you have the following development tools and libraries installed on your system:

1.  **Git:** For cloning the repository.
    - [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2.  **CMake (version 3.16 or higher):** For managing the build process.
    - [Download CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
3.  **Qt5 (version 5.x.x):** The core framework. You will need the development libraries for the following Qt modules: `Qt Core`, `Qt GUI`, `Qt Widgets`, `Qt Network`, and `Qt Multimedia` (including `Q5MultimediaWidgets`).
4.  **FFmpeg Development Libraries:** Essential for multimedia support (audio/video decoding, encoding, streaming). You'll need libraries like `libavcodec-dev`, `libavformat-dev`, `libavutil-dev`, etc.

    - **On Ubuntu/Debian:** `sudo apt update && sudo apt install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev`
    - **On Fedora:** `sudo dnf install ffmpeg-devel`
    - **On Windows:** This is more complex. You'll typically download pre-built FFmpeg development packages (e.g., from [Gyan.dev](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) or [BtbN](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases)), extract them, and then add their `bin` and `lib` directories to your system's PATH or include them directly in your project configuration.
      Using a package manager like MSYS2/vcpkg is often simpler, since my recommendation: **use** `vcpkg`.

5.  **C++ Compiler:** A C++20 compatible compiler toolchain installed for your operating system.
6.  **libpqxx** library - managing PostgreSQL database and connection.

After setting up everything, you should be able to just compile the cloned repo/code on your own machine. By default, Wavelength uses exterrnal server, so for a solitary experience, host your own server, by installing `Node` and neccessary packages from [server directory](./server/) - `npm i`.

Configuration of your own server can be provided via `Wavelength Settings` tab (in application), where you can paste your `server address` and `server port`.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

I've currently found only one issue when using PTT in chat. The issue is only related to `Arch Linux` and `arch` based linuxes family, since they have very minimalistic pre-installed configurations. You need to properly configure **audio pipeline**.

```
sudo pacman -S pipewire-pulse pipewire-alsa pipewire-jack
```

```
systemctl --user restart pipewire pipewire-pulse wireplumber
```

Also, _Arch_ has some problems with audio buffers (again: lack of bunch of mostly default pre-installed audio codecs), so for using Arch (just like me: I use arch, btw.) it is advised to use `archlinux-audio-fix` branch.

Rest of the issues, enhancements and ideas for future or in development can be seen in [Issue](https://github.com/szymonwilczek/wavelength/issues) GitHub tab.
