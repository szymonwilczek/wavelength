     * to calculate control handles for the BÃ©zier curves, effectively creating a
     * Catmull-Rom spline effect with a specified tension. Includes validation to skip
     * invalid points.

     * @param num_of_points The number of control points in the vector. Should match control_points.size().
     * @return A QPainterPath representing the smooth outline of the blob. Returns an empty path if control_points is empty.
